# Welcome to My App

My app is so great, sometimes it works! Just download the script, add some execute permissions, and run it. The results should show you a list of all the cat pictures on your machine.

## Code Highlighting

You can use JavaScript code blocks to highlight what's up in your code:

```javascript
// Your JavaScript code goes here
console.log("Hello, GitHub!");
